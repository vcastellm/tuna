Tuna is a tool to inspect JavaScript objects. It is a tool to digg in the details of JavaScript object instances that tries to define an standard way to visualize the object hierarchy. 

The motivation for writing this library is to extend the core JavaScript object inspection capabilities and define a standard way of looking in to instances inspired by AS3 describeType() function. Contrary to describeType instead of returning XML object definition it is based on JavaScript objects or JSON objects.

Use
